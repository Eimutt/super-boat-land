## Workflow
* DON'T work on the same scene as others (Very important!!!!)
* Make sure master is a working version of the game
* Create branches for new features, pull request to develop (You can merge the PR without reviews)
* Create a pull request from develop to master when major progress has been made
* Assign yourself to issues that you work on and create a new branch for it
